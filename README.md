# SimpleGameTZ

Technical task for Midnight.Works

A project made primarily in C++ with some blueprint logic
Widget creation is done using level blueprints. It can be made via game modes created specifically for every level, but for a low-scale project like this, it's just more work for nothing.
Footstep, jump, and landing sounds made in animations via sound notify
Animations I get from Mixamo, not mine, so that is the reason why they are laggy.
Textures and static mesh assets got from the quixel bridge
All widget logic is made in C++, the visual is made in BP, and elements are connected via meta=(BindWidget).
For tracking scores, use Game State and delegates.
